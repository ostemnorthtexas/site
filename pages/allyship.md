## Allyship Alphabet Soup

There are a lot of terms used by the LGBTQ+ community and the those involved in
diversity work at large.
The ones listed here are some that are common or used within the community.

### General Terms

* **BIPOC** stands for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.

* **DEI** stands for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.

fence. The first pane is reality, the second is equality, the third is equity,
and the fourth is liberation. Reality has 1 person on many boxes,
a second on one box, and a third in a hole.
In equality, everyone has 1 box. In equity, the tall person has no boxes, the
middle person has one box, and the short person has 2 boxes. In liberation,
there are no boxes, because the fence is gone."

* **URM** stands for Underrepresented Minority.
It has a very specific meaning by funding organizations which has been
co-opted to broadly mean any underrepresented group.
A number of people consider its usage to be
[harmful](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/245710-underrepresented-minority-considered-harmful-racist-language/fulltext).

* **WDF** means Withdraw/Failing.
It's used by academics to describe people who withdrew or failed a course
in the pursuit of improving student retention.

### LGBTQ+

Another moderately comprehensive list can be found on the
[IPM website](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2013/01/a-comprehensive-list-of-lgbtq-term-definitions/).

* **AFAB** and **AMAB** stand for "Assigned Female At Birth" and
"Assigned Male At Birth", respectively.
They are often used to describe sexual health needs that pertain to
assumed anatomical features.
Many people do not like these terms because they emphasize the fascination
of people with a trans person's genitals.

* **Agender** is described as lacking a personal gender identity, or having
a neutral gender indentity.

* **Aromantic** is a romantic orientation described by experiencing little or
no romantic attraction to others.

* **Asexual** is a sexual orientation described by the lack of sexual attraction
to other people.

* **Bisexual** is a sexual orientation that describes people who are attracted
to two or more genders.

* **Cisgender** means that someone's gender identity matches the sex they were
assigned at birth.
A cisgender woman had "female" marked on their original birth certificate and
considers themself to be a woman.
A cisgender man had "male" marked on their original birth certificate and
considers themself to be a man.

* **Clocking** is a term used to describe when someone picks up that another
person is in the LGBTQ+ community without them coming out (though the term is
often trans-specific).

* **Enby** is an abbreviation for non-binary.
Sometimes it will be written as *NB*, which is problematic because the NB
abbreviation is used for Non-Black.

* **FTM** and **MTF** stands for "Female-To-Male" and "Male-To-Female",
respectively.
FTM describes the transition of trans men, whereas MTF describes the transition
of trans women.
The terms are considered to be descriptive, yet offensive, because they imply
that trans identities need to make sense using a cisgender framework (moving
from birth to now), as well as reducing trans identities to genitalia.
Historically, it is how members of the trans community identified themselves,
and there are some people today who find the term empowering.

* **FTX** and **MTX** mean "female-to-non-binary" and "male-to-non-binary",
respectively.
The *X* is often used as a third gender symbol for legal identification in
places where a third symbol exists.
These terms are generally used to find resources within the trans and
non-binary community.

* **Gay** is a sexual attraction that describes men who are attracted
exclusively to other men.
In recent years, gay has often been used as an umbrella term for people
with non-straight sexual orientations.

* **Gender Dysphoria** is the feeling of conflict between assigned gender
and gender identity. Common causes of dysphoria include body shape, body hair
(or lack thereof), voice, and reproductive processes (such as menstruation and
erection).

* **Gender Euphoria** is the euphoric state that can come from being recognized
as your gender, or by doing gender-affirming things. For instance, a trans
feminine person may experience gender euphoria by wearing a skirt.

* **GNC** stands for gender non-conforming.
This term can apply to both cisgender and transgender individuals
(ex. a cis woman with short hair, a trans man wearing nail polish).

* **GRS** stands for gender reassignment surgery.
It is an updated term for the traditional *SRS*, which stands for sexual
reassignment surgery.

* **GSA** stands for Gay-Straight Alliance.
GSAs are usually student organizations built around pushing for equality of
LGBTQ+ persons.

* **GSM** stands for gender and sexual minorities.
It is occasionally used in the literature as an alternative for LGBTQ+.

* **Intersex** is a term used to describe individuals whose personal body
composition (including chromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitals) are not
adequately described by the binary male and female sex categories.

* **LGBTQ+** stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning,
and other gender and sexual minorities (including asexuality).
The acronym has several alternative forms with more or less letters:
    - LGB: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual
    - LGBT: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender
    - LGBTQIA: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, Intersex,
    Asexual
    - LGBTQIAPK: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, Intersex,
    Asexual, Pansexual, Kink

* **Lesbian** is a term used for women who are attracted exclusively to
other women.

* **MLM** and **WLM** mean "Men who Love Men" and "Women who Love Women",
respectively.
They are largely used on the Internet.

* **MSM** and **WSM** mean "Men who have Sex with Men" and "Women who have Sex
with Women", respectively.
They are most often used in a medical context (i.e., the MSM restrictions on
blood donations).

* **Neutrois** is a gender identity that falls under the transgender umbrella.
It is sometimes described as gender neutral or agender.

* **Non-Binary** is an umbrella term for genders that do not conform to the
woman/man binary framework.
Within the non-binary community are a wealth of terms, including agender,
genderqueer, genderfluid, and genderflux.

* **Pansexual** is a sexual orientation that describes people who are attracted
to other people without regard for gender.

* **PGP** stands for proper gender pronouns.
These are the set (or sets) of pronouns that a person wants used for themself.
It was used as preferred gender pronouns in the past, but that term implies
that using the correct pronouns for someone is a preference and not an
obligation.

* **Polyam** is an abbreviated form of polyamorous.
It is occasionally shortened as *poly*, which is problematic because the Poly
abbreviation is used to mean Polynesian.

* **QTPOC** stands for Queer and Trans People Of Color.

* **Queer** is used generally in place of the LGBTQ+ acronym (it's easier!).
It has a historical use as a pejorative, so there are many LGBTQ+ people who
do not feel comfortable using the term for themselves.
Always respect someone's wishes to not have *queer* applied to them!

* **Stealth** describes the act of hiding a trans identity post-transition.
Being stealth is generally done for either safety or because a person doesn't
feel an obligation to be visibly trans.

* **STP** stands for Stand-To-Pee.
STP devices are sometimes used by trans masculine people to more easily
urinate while standing and/or use a urinal.

* **TERF** stands for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminism.
It describes people who have trans-exclusive views, and who often work to harm
and undermine transgender people.

* **TGNC** stands for Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming.

* **Transgender** means that someone's gender identity does not match sex they
were assigned at birth.
It is often abbreviated to "trans", and the word is used as an adjective
(i.e., a transgender person **NOT** a transgender).
Sometimes "trans" appears as Trans<sup>\*</sup> to explain its use as an
umbrella term comprised of many different identities.
Because gender identity is separate from sexual orientation, it is important to
remember that straight trans people are included in the LGBTQ+ community.

The same identity can mean different things to different people, especially
when it comes to trans identities.

Gender and sexuality often described using the Genderbread person.

a heart marked attraction, a body outline marked expression, and a transgender
symbol between the legs marked sex. There are sliding scales from null to
womanness and null to manness for each of these categories below the person."

## Being an Ally for the LGBTQ+ Community

There are many, many things you can do to work toward becoming an ally for the
LGBTQ+ community. Just because some things appear in a checklist, does not
mean they are the _only_ things you can (or should) be doing.

* Speak up
    - If you see someone getting mistreated because of their gender or
    sexuality, call out the mistreatment.
* If you're going to ask about relationships, don't impose a heteronormative
context
    - Don't assume that a woman has (or wants) a husband, or that a man has
    (or wants) a wife
* Stop assuming someone's gender identity
    - Often times, we put people into the boxes of man or woman based on their
    gender expression, and doing this actually makes it really hard to
    acknowledge that people whose identities do not match their gender expression
    are actually their gender.
    - Example: it is often very hard for cisgender gender-conforming
    individuals to understand that a person with a beard could actually be a woman.
    This can lead to "gender-policing", where you will only accept someones
    trans identity if they fit into a very specific definition of what it means
    to be that gender.
* Eliminating gendered language
    - Every time "he/she" is used in writing, your transgender friends cringe.
    "They" is broader and challenges the gender binary (and sexism!) that
    comes from "he/she".
* Say what you mean
    - If you're teaching a class about pregnancy but only using the phrase
    "pregnant women," you're leaving out people who do not identify themselves
    as women with your words. Instead, opt for something like "pregnant people."
* Normalize Sharing Your Pronouns
    - Sharing your pronouns means introducing yourself with your pronouns, or
    otherwise making them clear. Consider adding them to your introduction
    slide, email signature, Twitter bio, name tags, and business cards.
    - Normalizing the sharing of pronouns makes it easier for trans people to
    assert their pronouns. However, if you're sharing your pronouns but not
    actually using the ones that others share with you, your sharing is just
    an empty gesture.
* Learn About Microaggressions, And Just... Stop.
    - "That's so gay!"
    - "I'm so glad you can get gay married!"
    - "Wow, I never would have guessed you were trans."
    - "Um, excuse me, you're in the wrong bathroom. This is the women's room."
    - "Have you had the surgery?"
    - "You don't act gay!"
    - "You just haven't met the right man."
    - "Wait, you're religious?"
* Drop the Gendered Awards
    - If your school or program has a "best female" and "best male" award
    category, change it to the top two students (looking at you,
    Homecoming King/Queen). Having two separate categories based on gender
    often excludes transgender and non-binary individuals from participating, or,
    worse, only allows their participation under their gender assigned at birth.
* Learn About Policies and Advocate for Better
    - Things like sexual orientation and gender identity not being included in
    equal opportunity policies, being required to have a legal name announced
    at graduation, and excluding gender-affirming care in student health
    insurance policies are just some of the ways that LGBTQ+ students are let
    down by campus policies.
