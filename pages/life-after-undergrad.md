## To Disclose or Not to Disclose...

That *is* the question. Whether you
- are out after undergrad
- include oSTEM on your résumé/CV
- join or form an LGBTQ+ employee resource group
or don't is entirely up to you.

Coming out is a lifelong process, and sometimes for you personal safety and
security you cannot be out.
It's unfortunate that the world puts us in such a predicament, but at the
end of the day, we're all just humans trying to get by.

A lot of people give the advice that if prospective companies wouldn't hire
you because of your LGBTQ+ identity, you wouldn't want to work there anyway.
That's all well and good, but it doesn't help you land or maintain a job.
Nobody but you can make the decision about being out in the workplace.
