## Updating Your Name at UNT

UNT allows students to have chosen names listed on rosters, Canvas, student IDs,
and most other locations where a non-legal name can be used (i.e., tax forms,
financial aid, and transcripts).
To update your chosen name, you must fill out a
[form](https://registrar.unt.edu/sites/default/files/Preferred%20Name%20Change%20Form.pdf)
with the Registrar's Office. You can read more about that on their page about
[updating information](https://registrar.unt.edu/transcripts-and-records/update-your-personal-information).

The [Pride Alliance](https://ied.unt.edu/names-unt) has more information
about updating different systems to use your chosen name across campus.

## Housing at UNT

The [Pride Alliance](https://ied.unt.edu/trans-students-and-university-housing)
works with Residence Life to make reasonable on-campus housing accomodations
for transgender students.

## Emailing Professors

Some trans students find it helpful to email their professors before the start
of a new semester to disclose their trans status and explain that their
chosen name is different from their legal name.
There's no guarantee your professor will read the email before class and
remember though, so sometimes it feels like more effort than it's worth.
You are never obligated to disclose your trans status.

> Dear Professor X,
>
> I am a student in your XXX course this semester in the XXX section.
> I am emailing you to let you know that the name on the roster (AAA) is
> different from the name that I go by (BBB).
> I will be turning in work under BBB, and request that you use that name for
> me in all course activities.
> I also ask that you use CCC pronouns when referring to me.
> A practical example of this would be something like "This is BBB, and CCC are
> a STEM major."
> If you have any questions, feel free to email me at DDD.
>
> Sincerely,
> BBB

While it is always best to be professional in emails to faculty, if you have
a prior relationship with them, it is perfectly acceptable to send an email
like:

> Hi Professor X,
>
> Just wanted to let you know that I go by BBB now instead of AAA.
> Please use BBB for me in class this semester.
>
> Thanks,
> BBB

## Legal Transition

Legal transition is the process of legally changing one's identity documents
to reflect and updated name and/or an updated gender.
You can update either of these independently, but many people choose to change
them both at the same time to save time and money.

If you are a minor, then there are specific forms for changing your name
and gender marker than for adults.
Specific information on this process (as it varies based on parental status)
can be obtained from
[Texas Law Help(https://texaslawhelp.org/toolkit/i-want-change-my-childs-name).

Texas has an e-file system, so you can do submit all the paperwork for the
legal name and gender marker change online.
The way the state's law is written is _just vague_ enough that you don't have
to go through the Denton County court to change your name and/or gender marker.
Travis County Law Library creates an
[Adult Gender Name Change Kit](https://lawlibrary.traviscountytx.gov/images/pdf/Gender/TC-FM-GI2-200-Adult-Gender-Name-Change-Kit-Sept-2019.pdf)
with the required legal forms for a name and gender marker change, as well
as information on completing them.
UNT's [Student Legal Services](https://studentaffairs.unt.edu/student-legal-services)
can also provide guidance on this process.

updating names and gender markers on identification documents.

### Places to Update Your Name After a Legal Name/Gender Marker Change

- [Passport](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/change-of-sex-marker.html)
    - For a gender change as well, you **MUST** use a DS-11 form and pay the

### Do I have to register with Selective Service?

If your original birth certificate listed your sex as male, you are
_required_ to register with selective service before the age of 25, regardless
of whether you are trans or not.
The [SSS FAQ](https://www.sss.gov/faq/) page explains this in more detail.

If your original birth certificate listed your sex as female, you are _never
required_ to register with Selective Service.
However, not registering (if you are under 26 when you transition) may make
things more difficult for you later in life, namely with things like
completing FAFSA and employment on-boarding.
In this case, you should request a
[Status Information Letter](https://www.sss.gov/verify/sil/) to keep in your
permanent records to present when challenged about not having registered.
That stated, many states will automatically register you with Selective Service
when you update the gender marker on your license and are under the age of 26.
As of [2011](https://www.sss.gov/register/state-commonwealth-legislation/),
Texas is a state with automatic registration.

## Gender-Affirming Shapewear

Some trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals like to
experiment with shapewear, and may decide to incorporate such products into
their daily wardrobe.

### Trans feminine/non-binary

Breast forms, padded underwear, and gaffs are some of the common shapewear
trans feminine individuals may use to affirm their gender.
A gaff is used to tuck the genintals.

- [Leo Lines Etsy (affirming underwear)](https://www.etsy.com/shop/LeoLines)
- [GenderCat Prosthetics (nsfw)](https://gendercat.com/)

### Trans masculine/non-binary

Trans masculine individuals may use binders and packers to affirm their
gender.
Binders apply pressure to hold down the chest, and packers are underwear
inserts.
Stand-to-pee devices (STPs) may also be combined with a packer, or their own
item.

- [GenderCat Prosthetics (nsfw)](https://gendercat.com/)

### Buying Shapewear Discreetly

There are many reasons you may be afraid to try out shapewear, one of which
being that internet purchases require credit or debit card information
that other people have access to, or because your mail isn't private.

Two ways you can get around this are:
- Giving a trusted friend the money to buy it for you, or asking to have it
shipped to their residence.
- Purchasing a VISA gift card with cash and using it to buy online. If you
choose this method, make sure you have enough money on the card to cover
the tax and shipping costs!!!

The Pride Alliance does have some binder in their
[Clothing Closet](https://ied.unt.edu/outfits-clothing-closet).

## Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) consists of taking hormones as a course of
medical treatment with the intent to alter the body's secondary sex
characteristics, such as hair, chest tissue, muscle mass, and voice.
You do **_NOT_** have to want HRT to be trans, and whether you undergo HRT or
not does not make you any more or less trans.
The process of starting HRT can be rife with emotions, and it is important to
have a support system during such a time.

Trans feminine pursuing HRT typically seek estrogen hormone replacement therapy.
Estrogen is often referred to as "E" within the trans community.

- [Fenway Health Informed Consent for Feminizing Therapy (Spanish)](https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/Informed-Consent-for-Feminizing-Hormone-Therapy-4-2019-Spanish.pdf)

Trans masculine pursuing HRT typically seek testosterone hormone replacement
therapy.
Testosterone is often referred to as "T" within the trans community.

- [Fenway Health Informed Consent for Masculinizing Therapy (Spanish)](https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/Informed-Consent-for-Masculinizing-Hormone-Therapy-4-2019-Spanish.pdf)

You can stop HRT at any time, but it is advised that you consult a doctor to
taper off in a healthy way.

## Surgery

There are many different types of surgery that transgender people can choose to
undergo.
Like with hormones, you do not need surgery to be trans, and you are not
more or less trans for having had surgery.

More about the different procedures and surgeons that perform them are
available at these links:
